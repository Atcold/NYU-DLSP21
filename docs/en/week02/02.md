## Lecture part A


## Lecture part B


## Practicum
We discuss the motivation for applying transformations to data points visualized in space. We talk about Linear Algebra and the application of linear and non-linear transformations. We discuss the use of visualization to understand the function and effects of these transformations. We walk through examples in a Jupyter Notebook and conclude with a discussion of functions represented by neural networks.
